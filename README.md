<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

With many blockchains currently running in silos with their respective wallets, it's hard to track your coins and their performance. TrackMyCoins is meant to simplify this process by providing an interface to track your coins.

The program will ask you to input your coins then display their current worth, save that data locally, and display a chart of how your coins' performance is doing over time.
